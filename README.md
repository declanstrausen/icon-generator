# SVG Icon Generator

This code defines a canvas element for the icon and a button that generates a random icon when clicked. When the user clicks the "Generate Icon" button, the `generateIcon()` function generates a random background color and fills the canvas with it. It then generates a random foreground color, and randomly selects a shape to draw (circle or square). If a circle is selected, it draws a circle in the center of the canvas with a radius of one-fourth of the canvas width. If a square is selected, it draws a square in the center of the canvas with a width and height of one-half of the canvas width. You can modify the code to generate different types of shapes or use different colors and options.
